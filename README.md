# Estimation-of-a-non-linear-function

## Context

In this project, seasonal species migration is modeled. Many species show bimodal migratory pattern depicting spring and autumn migrations

## Objective

Build a neural network to estimate a non-linear function that models the bimodal migratory pattern.

## Results

Blue points correspond to the original data for migration. The orange line is the predicted non-linear function by the neural network with an 1-4-1 architecture, 20,000 epochs and a learning rate of 1.
